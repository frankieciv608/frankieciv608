- 👋 Hi, I’m @frankieciv608. I am learning on Coursera with the IBM Skills Network for Data Analytics. I also completed the Google Data Ananlytics Professional Certificate.
- I am learning and ready to put in the work that is needed. I started an account on GitHub years ago but was unsure how to use and learning it as I go. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics, Data Science and Statistics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Excel and R. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the right way so I can become gainfully employed in Analytics.
